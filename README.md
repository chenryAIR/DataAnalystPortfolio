### Python:
*Driving Distance and Driving Time Calculations using HERE API*</br>
250,000 preK students in Oklahoma needed to be linked to the nearest preK center. To reduce the cost and the amount of time to process the data, I first calculated the linear distance between each student for every preK center using the latitudes and longitudes. I then used the HERE API to calculate the drive times for the ten closest centers determined by the linear distance. These results were used in the following report. NOTE: The code for this is not available, but you can see the code for a smaller project using HERE below.

*[PYTHON Geocoding Addresses with HERE API.py](https://github.com/chenryAIR/DataAnalystPortfolio/blob/main/PYTHON%20Geocoding%20Addresses%20with%20HERE%20API.py)*</br>
40k addresses needed to be geocoded quickly with a small level of descriptions to determine the quality of the geocodes (e.g., the number of geocodes with a score < 0.9 and number of geocodes by result type).
